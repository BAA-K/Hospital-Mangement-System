# Hospital Management System

Hospital Management System is a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) full-stack project that includes a landing page and a dashboard.

## Landing Page

The landing page provides information about the hospital. Users can perform the following actions:

-   **Login/Register**: Users can login or register to access additional features.
-   **Send a Message**: Users can send a message to the hospital.
-   **Make an Appointment**: Users can make appointments by selecting a doctor, department, and date.
-   **Logout**: Users can logout from the account.

The landing page is responsive and designed to work seamlessly on various devices such as mobile, tablet, and computer screens. It includes smooth scroll animations for a professional user experience.

## Dashboard

The dashboard is designed for administrators to manage the hospital system. It consists of the following features:

-   **Admin Login**: Administrators can log in to access the dashboard.
-   **Dashboard Overview**: After logging in, the admin's name is displayed at the top, along with the number of doctors and appointments in the hospital.
-   **Appointment Management**: Administrators can view appointments in a table format. The table includes patient names and emails. Admins can perform various actions on appointments such as accept, reject, or set them to pending. They can also update appointment details.
-   **Admin Management**: Administrators have the authority to add other administrators to the system.
-   **Doctor Management**: Admins can add doctors to the system. Adding a doctor requires providing their name, email, password, department, and an image.
